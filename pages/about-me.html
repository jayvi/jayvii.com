        <h3 class="h3 text-white">A little About Me</h3>

        <p>
            I'm a web developer from Plovdiv | BG <br/><br/>
            The city of the Seven Hills and <br/>
            World's Sixth Oldest City.<br/>
            <br/>
            I like to work on anything from graphic design to front and backend web programming.
            I've recently fallen in love with NodeJS, ES6, Big Data websites and basically everything else that is object oriented.
        </p>

            and much more.
